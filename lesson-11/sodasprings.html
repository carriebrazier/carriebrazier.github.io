                <h4>Geyser Park</h4>
                <img class="geyser" src="images/geyser.jpg">
                <p>Soda Springs has the only captive geyser in the world. It was discovered in an attempt to find a hot water source 
                        for a swimming pool. On November 30, 1937, the drill went down 315 feet and unleashed the geyser. The extreme pressure
                        ed by carbon dioxide gas mixing with water in an underground chamber. It is now capped and controlled by a timer. It 
                        erupts every hour on the hour. The geyser reaches heights of 100 feet year round.</p>
                        
                        <p>There is a Visitor Center which features interpretive signs and restrooms in the park. There is a boardwalk around 
                        the geyser and grassy areas with picnic tables and benches to enjoy the day and view the geyser. The geyser is located 
                        behind the Enders Hotel located on 1st South and Main.</p>
                        <p>The Oregon Trail passed through Soda Springs. At the time it was known as the "Oasis of Soda Springs". Between Fort 
                        Laramie and Fort Boise, Soda Springs was a major landmark and is the second oldest settlement in Idaho.[1] Sulphur Springs
                         was the first hot spring that the Oregon Trail immigrants encountered in the soda springs area. Pyramid springs was discovered
                          by fur trappers and pioneers, they discovered the springs by noticing mounds of soda formed rock and clay. Johnkirk Townsends 
                          said in his diary, “Our encampment on the 8th was near what are called the’White Clay pits,” still on Bear River. The soil is 
                          soft chalk, white and tenacious: and in the vicinity are several springs of strong super carbonated water which bubble up with 
                          all the activity of artificial fountains. The taste was very agreeable and refreshing, resembling Saratoga water but not so 
                          saline. The whole plain to the hills is having depressions on their summits from which once issued streams of water. The extent 
                          of these eruptions, at some former period, must have been very great. At about half a mile distant, is an eruptive thermal 
                          spring of the temperature of 90 [degrees], and near this is an opening in the earth front which a stream of gas issues without 
                          water.”</p>
